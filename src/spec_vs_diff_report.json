  "summary": "The diff does not implement an actual “publish current draft to live (non-expiring) deployment” mechanism; it mostly adds a deployment guide document and includes substantial unrelated backend/frontend feature work and UI changes that go beyond the publishing-only scope.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Publish the currently deployed draft of the application to a live (non-expiring) deployment so it remains accessible without requiring a rebuild.",
      "reason": "No concrete deployment configuration/automation or release artifact changes are shown—only documentation. There’s no evidence in the diff of creating a live deployment from the current project state (e.g., CI/CD, dfx.json/network config, canister ID management, or scripts) that would ensure a non-expiring live deployment without rebuilding.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Published app is reachable via its live URL and loads the main route ('/').",
      "reason": "The diff cannot demonstrate reachability or successful load of the live URL; it only adds a doc with manual verification steps. No deployment output, URL, or configuration changes are present that would enable/guarantee live route availability.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Backend canister calls function as they did in the draft deployment (no regressions introduced by publishing).",
      "reason": "There is no deployment-oriented change demonstrating preserved canister IDs/endpoints for live, and the backend file shows large functional/type additions that could affect behavior (potential regressions) rather than a publishing-only change.",

    {
      "description": "Large expansion/changes to backend domain model and functionality (e.g., messaging, delivery, bargains, claims types) unrelated to publishing to live.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly states the goal is publishing and the non-goal is implementing new features or changing UI/UX beyond what’s required to publish; these additions appear to be new product features.",

      "description": "Major frontend routing and page surface area (wishlist, reports, admin, claims flows, delivery, partner dashboard, shopkeeper pages, messaging thread pages).",

      "description": "Added a deployment guide telling users to run `dfx deploy --network ic` and manual smoke tests.",
      "reason": "REQ-1 asks to publish the currently deployed draft to live without requiring a rebuild; a generic redeploy command plus manual checks is not explicitly requested as a deliverable and suggests rebuilding/redeploying rather than promoting an existing draft deployment.",
