# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish the current Bargen draft (Version 4) as a live, non-draft deployment with a stable shareable public URL.

**Planned changes:**
- Create a new live (non-draft) deployment from the current Version 4 state without requiring additional user input.
- Provide a distinct live/shareable URL for the published version (separate from the draft preview link).
- Verify the published live version loads successfully and matches the current draft functionality (product browsing, cart, bargaining, messaging, and INR price display).

**User-visible outcome:** The user can share a stable public link that opens Bargen in a browser and behaves the same as the current Version 4 draft.
